   * switching legs. When switching legs, the sender looks up its current
   * absolute sequence number as the maximum of all legs. The sender then
   * compares that to the current sequence number on the leg it is about to
   * send on, and then computes the relative sequence number as the difference
   * between the overall absolute sequence number and the sequence number

   * In this way, we can use much smaller relative sequence numbers on the

   * bookkeeping overhead on each end.
