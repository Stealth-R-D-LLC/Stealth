/**
 * @file conftypes.h
 * @brief Types used to specify configurable options.
 *
 * This header defines the types that different modules will use in order to
 * declare their configuration and state variables, and tell the configuration
 * management code about those variables.  From the individual module's point
 * of view, its configuration and state are simply data structures.
 *
 * For defining new variable types, see var_type_def_st.h.
 *
 * For the code that manipulates variables defined via this module, see
 * lib/confmgt/, especially typedvar.h and (later) structvar.h.  The
 * configuration manager is responsible for encoding, decoding, and
 * maintaining the configuration structures used by the various modules.
 *
 * STATUS NOTE: This is a work in process refactoring.  It is not yet possible
 *   for modules to define their own variables, and much of the configuration
 *   management code is still in src/app/config/.
