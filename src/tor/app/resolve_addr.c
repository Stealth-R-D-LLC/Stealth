/** @brief Attempt to find our IP address that can be used as our external
 *         reachable address.
 *
 *  The following describe the algorithm to find an address. Each have
 *  specific conditions so read carefully.
 *
 *  On success, true is returned and depending on how the address was found,
 *  the out parameters can have different values.
 *
 *  On error, false is returned and out parameters are set to NULL.
 *
 *  1. Look at the configuration Address option.

 *     If Address is a public address, True is returned and addr_out is set
 *     with it, the method_out is set to RESOLVED_ADDR_CONFIGURED and
 *     hostname_out is set to NULL.
 *
 *     If Address is an internal address but NO custom authorities are used,
 *     an error is returned.
 *
 *     If Address is a hostname, that is it can't be converted to an address,
 *     it is resolved. On success, addr_out is set with the address,
 *     method_out is set to RESOLVED_ADDR_RESOLVED and hostname_out is set
 *     to the resolved hostname. On failure to resolve, an error is returned.
 *
 *     If no given Address, fallback to the network interface (see section 2).
 *
 *  2. Look at the network interface.
 *
 *     Attempt to find the first public usable address from the list of
 *     network interfaces returned by the OS.
 *
 *     On failure, we attempt to look at the local hostname (3).
 *
 *     On success, addr_out is set with it, method_out is set to
 *     RESOLVED_ADDR_INTERFACE and hostname_out is set to NULL.
 *
 *  3. Look at the local hostname.
 *
 *     If the local hostname resolves to a non internal address, addr_out is
 *     set with it, method_out is set to RESOLVED_ADDR_GETHOSTNAME and
 *     hostname_out is set to the resolved hostname.
 *
 *     If a local hostname can NOT be found, an error is returned.
 *
 *     If the local hostname resolves to an internal address, an error is
 *     returned.
 *
 *     If the local hostname can NOT be resolved, an error is returned.
 *
 * @param options Global configuration options.
 * @param family IP address family. Only AF_INET and AF_INET6 are supported.
 * @param warn_severity Logging level.
 * @param addr_out OUT: Set with the IP address found if any.
 * @param method_out OUT: (optional) Method denoting how the address wa
 *                   found. This is described in the control-spec.txt as
 *                   actions for "STATUS_SERVER".
 * @param hostname_out OUT: String containing the hostname if any was used.
 *                     Only be set for RESOLVED and GETHOSTNAME methods.
 *                     Else it is set to NULL.
 *
 * @return True if the address was found for the given family. False if not or
 *         on errors.
