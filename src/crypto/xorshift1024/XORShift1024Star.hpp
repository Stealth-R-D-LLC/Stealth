/* This generator has been replaced by xoroshiro1024*, which is
   faster and has better statistical properties.

   NOTE: as of 2017-10-08, this generator has a different multiplier (a
   fixed-point representation of the golden ratio), which eliminates
   linear dependencies from one of the lowest bits. The previous
   multiplier was 1181783497276652981 (M_8 in the paper). If you need to
   tell apart the two generators, you can refer to this generator as
   xorshift1024*Ï† and to the previous one as xorshift1024*M_8.

   This is a fast, high-quality generator. If 1024 bits of state are too
   much, try a xoroshiro128+ generator.

   Note that the two lowest bits of this generator are LFSRs of degree
   1024, and thus will fail binary rank tests. The other bits needs a much
   higher degree to be represented as LFSRs.

   We suggest to use a sign test to extract a random Boolean value, and
   right shifts to extract subsets of bits.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s. */
