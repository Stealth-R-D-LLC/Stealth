= Stealth [XST]

Stealth is a fast, feelesss, private, and scalable blockchain built on the Junaeth cryptocurrency protocol.
Stealth consensus is achieved through a novel protocol wherein validators, called "StealthNodes", are permanently bonded.
In other words, creating a StealthNode requires a one-way burn of XST, the functional currency of the Stealth blockchain.
Because StealthNodes are permanently bonded with irrevocable blockchain rights, StealthNode owners are beholden to no one, acting entirely independently and fully in the interests of their StealthNode assets.
StealthNodes are transferrable, and their value is tied objectively to their performance.

Because of Stealth's unique and efficient consensus protocol, it can offer feeless transactions, global scalability, and unparalleled spam resistance, without expensive proof-of-work (PoW) or any subservience to privileged stakeholders, like founders and other insiders.

Stealth also has a number of other unique technological advancements, including a distributed network clock that promotes regular blocktimes and therefore regular, 5 second feeless transaction confirmations.
Another advancement is temporally-bound memory-hard work for feeless transactions.
Temporal binding allows feeless transactions to expire, making sustained denial-of-service (DoS) prohibitively expensive.
Transaction expiration also allows for a quick (2 minute), no-fee resolution in the exceedingly rare event that a feeless transaction becomes stuck without confirmation.
No other cryptocurrency offers quick, feeless resolution to stuck transactions, which happen with every payment system.
