Intro
-----
Stealth is a free open source project derived from NovaCoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help to further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run StealthCoind:

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 4437 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Stealth works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Stealth network.


Upgrade
-------
All you existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade first backup wallet
StealthCoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown StealthCoind by
StealthCoind stop
Start up the new StealthCoind.
