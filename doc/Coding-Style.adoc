= Stealth Coding Style

Please be consistent with the existing coding style.

See `contrib/clang-format/Stealth-clang-format` for the precise specification.

== Block Style

[source,cpp]
----
// Group the pointer ("*") or reference ("&") character
//    as part of the type.
bool Function(char* psz, int n)
{
    // Comment summarising what this section of code does
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        // When something fails, return early.
        // Also, enclose even single-line blocks.
        if (!Something())
        {
            return false;
        }
        ...
    }

    // Success return is usually at the end
    return true;
}
----

In summary, these guidelines are roughly:

* ANSI/Allman block style (opening and closing braces on their own lines).
* Single-line code blocks should be enclosed in braces.
* 4 space indenting, no tabs.
* No extra spaces inside parenthesis; please don't do ( this )
* No space after function names, one space after if, for and while
* Group the pointer or reference character with the type, not the name.
* Try to wrap code and comments to 79 characters.
* The second and later lines in comment paragraphs in comments are indented
  three spaces.


== Variable Names

Variable names begin with the type in lowercase, like "`nSomeVariable"`.
Please don't put the first word of the variable name in lowercase
like "`someVariable`".

=== Common Types

* `n`    :  integer number: `short`, `unsigned short`, `int`, `unsigned int`,
             `int64_t`, `uint64_t`, sometimes `char` or `unsigned char` if
               used as a number
* `d`    :  `double`, `float`
* `f`    :  flag: `bool`, `int`, `unsinged int`, or `enum` if used as a
               flag or set of bitwise flags
* `p`    :  pointer or array, one `p` for each level of indirection
* `b`    :  `std::bitset`
* `v`    :  `std::vector` or similar list objects
* `str`  :  `std::string` object
* `map`  :  `std::map` or `std::multimap`
* `set`  :  `std::set` or `std::multiset`
* `bn`   :  `CBigNum` or OpenSSL `BIGNUM`
* `hash` :  `uint256`
* `psz`  :  pointer to null-terminated `string`
* `pch`  :  pointer to a `char` or `unsigned char` array
* `vch`  :  vector of `char` or `unsigned char`


== Locking/Mutex Usage Notes

The code is multi-threaded, and uses mutexes and the `CRITICAL_BLOCK` and `TRY_CRITICAL_BLOCK` macros to protect data structures.

Deadlocks due to inconsistent lock ordering.
For example, Thread 1 locks `cs_main` followed by `cs_wallet`, while Thread 2 locks them in the opposite order.
The result is a deadlock, as each waits for the other to release its lock.
The `debug.log` file reports lock order inconsistencies when the client is compiled with `-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER`.

A goal is to redesign the core code to have better-defined interfaces between components, where components perform the locks.
See the self-contained `CKeyStore` class and its `cs_KeyStore` lock as an example.
